# Update Requirements Started Document for Anubis Rails Application

## Objective
Update the Rails application requirements document that will serve as an input specification for the Anubis microservice project.

## Context
Anubis is a microservice responsible for orchestrating the delivery of paying student data to higher education institution APIs (Kroton, Est√°cio, etc.). It manages enrollment flows from Quero Bolsa and new marketplaces, organizing payloads and logging structured events with retry mechanisms.

## Input Sources
- **Base Requirements**: #file:inputs/started-requirements.md (Contains description, ER diagrams, and sketched flow diagrams). This is the document to be used as starting point.
- **Epic Documentation**: #file:inputs/epico.md (High-level project epic and goals)
- **Existing Codebase**: #folder:inputs/repositories/anubis (Starting point for Rails application structure). This repository  contains all the required Gems already installed and configured. Inclusive the database models for PostgreSQL.
- **Reference Architectures**:
  - Similar microservice pattern and stack: #folder:inputs/repositories/quero-deals
  - Integration examples: #folder:inputs/repositories/estacio-lead-integration
  - Integration examples: #folder:inputs/repositories/kroton-lead-integration

## Requirements Specification

### 1. Diagram Requirements
Replace all sketched diagrams with professional Mermaid diagrams:

**Visual Standards:**
- Use pastel color themes compatible with both dark and light browser themes
- Include relevant emojis for visual engagement and clarity
- Organize complex diagrams using subgraphs for better readability
- Size diagrams to fit A4 paper when printed (max width: 180mm)
- Use consistent color coding across all diagrams

**Mermaid Theme Configuration:**
```mermaid
%%{init: {
  'theme':'base',
  'themeVariables': {
    'primaryColor':'#E8F4FD',
    'primaryBorderColor':'#4A90E2',
    'primaryTextColor':'#2C3E50',
    'secondaryColor':'#F0F8E8',
    'tertiaryColor':'#FDF2E8',
    'quaternaryColor':'#F8E8F8',
    'lineColor':'#5D6D7E',
    'fontFamily':'Inter,Segoe UI,Arial'
  }
}}%%
```

## Output Deliverable
Generate: #file:outputs/anubis-rails-requirements-app.md that will start using as a base the content of #file:inputs/started-requirements.md
- Do one Diagram at a time, replacing the sketched diagrams with professional Mermaid diagrams.
- Ensure all diagrams follow the specified visual standards and Mermaid theme configuration.
- Maintain the original structure and content of the document, only replacing the diagrams.
