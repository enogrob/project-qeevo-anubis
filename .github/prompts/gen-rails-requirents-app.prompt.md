# Rails Application Requirements Generator

## Objective
Generate a comprehensive Rails application requirements document that serves as a complete specification for the Anubis microservice, including technical architecture, user stories, acceptance criteria, and implementation guidelines.

## Context
Anubis is a microservice responsible for orchestrating the delivery of paying student data to higher education institution APIs (Kroton, Est√°cio, etc.). It manages enrollment flows from Quero Bolsa and new marketplaces, organizing payloads and logging structured events with retry mechanisms.

## Input Sources
- **Base Requirements**: #file:inputs/started-requirements.md (Contains description, ER diagrams, and sketched flow diagrams)
- **Epic Documentation**: #file:inputs/epico.md (High-level project epic and goals)
- **Existing Codebase**: #folder:inputs/repositories/anubis (Starting point for Rails application structure)
- **Reference Architectures**:
  - Similar microservice pattern and stack: #folder:inputs/repositories/quero-deals
  - Integration examples: #folder:inputs/repositories/estacio-lead-integration
  - Integration examples: #folder:inputs/repositories/kroton-lead-integration

## Requirements Specification

### 1. Document Structure Requirements
Create a comprehensive requirements document with the following sections:
- **Executive Summary**: Project overview, scope, and objectives
- **System Architecture**: High-level system design and component interactions
- **Data Model**: Complete ERD with relationships, constraints, and data flows
- **Functional Requirements**: Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability, and reliability specs
- **API Specifications**: REST endpoints with request/response formats
- **Integration Requirements**: External API integrations and data flows
- **Technical Stack**: Rails-specific implementation details
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches
- **Deployment & Operations**: Infrastructure, monitoring, and maintenance

### 2. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
Structure user stories using the format:
```
**As a** [role]
**I want** [functionality]
**So that** [business value]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [expected outcome]
```

Focus on these key personas:
- System Administrator (manages integrations and monitoring)
- Student Data Processor (handles enrollment flows)
- Institution API Consumer (receives student data)
- Operations Team (monitors and troubleshoots)

### 3. Technical Architecture Requirements
Include detailed specifications for:
- **Rails Models**: ActiveRecord models with associations, validations, scopes
- **Controllers**: RESTful controllers with proper error handling
- **Services**: Business logic encapsulation and single responsibility
- **Jobs**: Background processing with Solid Queue integration
- **Database Design**: PostgreSQL schema with indexes and constraints
- **API Design**: Consistent REST API with proper HTTP status codes
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication for external APIs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and retry mechanisms

### 4. Diagram Requirements
Replace all sketched diagrams with professional Mermaid diagrams:

**Visual Standards:**
- Use pastel color themes compatible with both dark and light browser themes
- Include relevant emojis for visual engagement and clarity
- Organize complex diagrams using subgraphs for better readability
- Size diagrams to fit A4 paper when printed (max width: 180mm)
- Use consistent color coding across all diagrams

**Required Diagrams:**
- System Architecture Overview (component diagram)
- Data Flow Diagrams (sequence diagrams for key processes)
- Entity Relationship Diagram (enhanced with data types and constraints)
- Integration Flow Charts (flowcharts for sync/async processes)
- State Machine Diagrams (for subscription status transitions)
- Deployment Architecture (infrastructure diagram)

**Mermaid Theme Configuration:**
```mermaid
%%{init: {
  'theme':'base',
  'themeVariables': {
    'primaryColor':'#E8F4FD',
    'primaryBorderColor':'#4A90E2',
    'primaryTextColor':'#2C3E50',
    'secondaryColor':'#F0F8E8',
    'tertiaryColor':'#FDF2E8',
    'quaternaryColor':'#F8E8F8',
    'lineColor':'#5D6D7E',
    'fontFamily':'Inter,Segoe UI,Arial'
  }
}}%%
```

### 5. Rails-Specific Implementation Details
Include comprehensive coverage of:
- **Gemfile**: Required gems with version constraints
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific settings and secrets management
- **Database Migrations**: Complete migration files with proper indexing
- **Routing**: RESTful routes with nested resources where appropriate
- **Validations**: Model validations with custom validators
- **Callbacks**: ActiveRecord callbacks for business logic
- **Concerns**: Shared modules for DRY code organization
- **Serializers**: JSON serialization for API responses
- **Testing**: RSpec test structure with factories and fixtures

### 6. Quality Standards
Ensure the requirements document meets these criteria:
- **Completeness**: All functional and non-functional requirements covered
- **Clarity**: Clear, unambiguous language with concrete examples
- **Consistency**: Consistent terminology and formatting throughout
- **Traceability**: Requirements linked to business objectives
- **Testability**: Each requirement includes measurable acceptance criteria
- **Maintainability**: Document structure supports easy updates and revisions

## Output Deliverable
Generate: #file:outputs/anubis-rails-requirements-app.md

The output should be a production-ready requirements document that can serve as:
- Technical specification for development team
- Reference guide for code reviews and testing
- Documentation for future maintenance and enhancements
- Foundation for project planning and estimation
