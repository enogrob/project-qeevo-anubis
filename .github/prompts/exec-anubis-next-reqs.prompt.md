# Update Codebase According the next Requirements for Anubis Rails Application

## Objective
Update the Rails application project according to the next new requirements.

## Context
Anubis is a microservice responsible for orchestrating the delivery of paying student data to higher education institution APIs (Kroton, Est√°cio, etc.). It manages enrollment flows from Quero Bolsa and new marketplaces, organizing payloads and logging structured events with retry mechanisms.

## Input Sources
- **Epic Documentation**: #file:inputs/epico.md (High-level project epic and goals)
- **Existing Codebase**: #folder:src/anubis . This repository reflects the current state of the Anubis application.
- **Existing Documentation**: #file:inputs/started-requirements.md
- **Previous Feature implemented**: #file:issues/#4277/4277.md
- **Next Feature to be implemented**: #file:issues/#4278/4278.md
- **Reference Architectures**:
  - Similar microservice pattern and stack: #folder:inputs/repositories/quero-deals
  - Integration examples: #folder:inputs/repositories/estacio-lead-integration
  - Integration examples: #folder:inputs/repositories/kroton-lead-integration

## Requirements

- Implement all features described in the current feature file (#file:issues/#4278/4278.md).
- Follow best practices for code quality, security, and performance.
- Ensure the application is well-documented, including code comments and updated README files.
- Write unit and integration tests to cover new functionalities. For unit tests add under #folder:src/anubis/spec folder and integration in #folder:src/anubis/script for the new services.
- Use the reference architectures as a guide for structuring the code and implementing features if required.
- Ensure compatibility with the latest stable versions of Ruby and Rails.
- Maintain a clean and organized codebase, adhering to standard conventions and patterns.
- After implemented, update accordingly the documentation in #file:inputs/started-requirements.md to reflect the new state of the application and also #file:docs/test-specifications.md if necessary.

**Visual Standards:**
- Use pastel color themes compatible with both dark and light browser themes
- Include relevant emojis for visual engagement and clarity
- Organize complex diagrams using subgraphs for better readability
- Size diagrams to fit A4 paper when printed (max width: 180mm)
- Use consistent color coding across all diagrams
