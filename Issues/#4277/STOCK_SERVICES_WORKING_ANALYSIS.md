# Stock Services API - Working Script Analysis

## 🎯 Final Success: All Scripts Working!

The Stock Services API testing is now **100% complete** with all scripts working perfectly.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed in `test_stock_services_working.rb`

### 1. GraphQL Field Name Errors
**❌ Problem**: 
```graphql
# Wrong field names
getOffers {
  offers { ... }           # Should be "pageItems"
  pageInfo { ... }         # Should be "hasNext", "nextCursor" 
  totalCount               # Does not exist
}
```

**✅ Solution**:
```graphql
# Correct field names
getOffers {
  pageItems { ... }        # Correct array field
  hasNext                  # Boolean pagination flag
  nextCursor               # String pagination cursor
}
```

### 2. Offer Field Name Errors
**❌ Problem**:
```graphql
# Wrong Offer fields
{
  title                    # Should be "formattedName"
  fullPrice                # Should be "offeredPrice"
  originalPrice            # Does not exist
}
```

**✅ Solution**:
```graphql
# Correct Offer fields
{
  formattedName            # Human readable name
  offeredPrice             # Final discounted price
  discountPercentage       # Discount percentage
}
```

### 3. Missing CSRF Protection
**❌ Problem**: HTTP 400 errors due to missing CSRF headers

**✅ Solution**: Added `x-apollo-operation-name` header to all requests

### 4. Invalid Test Data
**❌ Problem**: Using non-existent offer IDs `[1, 2, 3, 123, 456]`

**✅ Solution**: Used real offer IDs `[125669, 5002503, 8007144]`

## 📊 Working Script Results
